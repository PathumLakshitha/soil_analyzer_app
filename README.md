# soil_analyzer_app

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a Flask-based web application designed for **soil classification in tea nurseries**. It integrates a **YOLOv8n classification model** to analyze soil properties and provides **appropriate soil pH adjustment recommendations and bramble mix percentages** for each identified soil type, ensuring optimal soil conditions for tea nurseries.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Machine learning model for **soil classification** (YOLOv8n)  
- Provides **soil pH adjustment recommendations**  
- Suggests **bramble mix percentages** for different soil types  
- User-friendly **web interface** built with Flask  
- Accepts **Excel-based soil data** for analysis  
- Responsive **UI design**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Flask, Pandas, YOLOv8n, TensorFlow/OpenCV)  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Frontend)  
- **Excel (soil_bramble_mix_ratio_data.xlsx)**
